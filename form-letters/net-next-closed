The merge window for v6.10 has begun and we have already posted our pull
request. Therefore net-next is closed for new drivers, features, code
refactoring and optimizations. We are currently accepting bug fixes only.

Please repost when net-next reopens after May 26th.

RFC patches sent for review only are obviously welcome at any time.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/process/maintainer-netdev.html#development-cycle
